# SQL and PowerBI Project

This project combines the power of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Excel, and PowerBI to analyze and visualize data for business insights. We imported data from Excel into SQL Server, performed data manipulation and joins in SQL, and then utilized PowerBI for visualization and analysis.

## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to streamline the data analysis process by leveraging SQL Server and PowerBI. By importing data from Excel into SQL Server, we ensured a centralized data repository, facilitating easier management and analysis. We utilized SSMS for data manipulation and then utilized PowerBI's powerful visualization capabilities to extract meaningful insights.

## Data Import

We imported data from Excel into SQL Server using SSMS. The imported data included information from four different tables.

## Data Analysis

With the data now stored in SQL Server, we performed various data analysis tasks using SQL queries. This included:

- Joining tables to combine related data.
- Filtering data based on specific criteria.
- Calculating aggregated metrics such as sums, averages, and counts.

Once the data was prepared, we connected PowerBI to the SQL Server database and imported the necessary tables. 
We then created interactive visualizations and reports to answer business questions about the hotel and provide insights into the data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the seamless integration between SQL Server, Excel, and PowerBI for efficient data management and analysis. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and PowerBI for visualization, we were able to derive valuable insights to drive business decisions. This workflow can be easily replicated and scaled to analyze larger datasets and address more complex business scenarios.
